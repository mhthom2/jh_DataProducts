Final project for Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products 

This repository contains files for the final project of the Johns Hopkins Developing Data Products course on Coursera. The files include the ui.R and server.R files for my black cherry tree volume prediction application. This web application predicts the amount timber that can be harvested from a black cherry tree with the given girth, or diameter at the height of 4'6", and the height of the tree. The other file, Presentation.Rmd, is a presentation explaining the need for this application.
